**Status: 85% Ready**

### What's Working:

- Core authentication system ‚úÖ
- Database connection ‚úÖ
- Payment integration ‚úÖ
- Main app functionality ‚úÖ

### Before Going Live:

1. Fix remaining hardcoded URLs (can be done after initial deployment)
2. Test the deployment with production URLs
3. Update Google OAuth callback URLs in Google Console
4. Set up monitoring and logging

### Deployment Priority:

1. **HIGH**: Deploy backend first to get production URLs
2. **HIGH**: Deploy frontend with backend URLs
3. **MEDIUM**: Fix remaining hardcoded URLs
4. **LOW**: Optimize and add monitoring

## üìã Current Status Summary

Your application is **READY for initial deployment** with core functionality working. The remaining hardcoded URLs are in secondary features and won't break the main app functionality.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with deployment now, then fix remaining URLs incrementally.
